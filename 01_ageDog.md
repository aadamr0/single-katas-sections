# ageDog

This function will take a **single dog object with an age property** and a **number**. You should increment the age property by the provided number and return **the aged dog**. The original dog object must not be mutated!

## Examples: 

```js
const dog = { name: 'Otis', age: 1 };

ageDog(dog, 1) // returns { name: 'Otis', age: 2 }

// dog is not mutated and still has the form { name: 'Otis', age: 1 }
```
